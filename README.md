MVP: A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.
  - make sure the API works! / renders Json result
  - incorp Flexbox into CSS styling
  - responsive design (iphone)
  - dropdown menu for beef/chicken/fish
  - return 2 receipes

Post-MVP: A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.
 - search for additional receipies
 - make prettier

Goals: I want to make sure the main page and JS is done by end of day Tuesday if not before.  Then I can focus on improving it and adding features to the page during the rest of the time.

Timeframes: 
 - I expect the JS to take two days as it will hold the majority of the coding. 
 - I expect to spend a half day to full day on CSS
 - the remining time will be spend on adding features / enhancements
